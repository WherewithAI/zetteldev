# Gambols

In Gambols, you are encouraged to be maximally creative. The researcher will ask you a question: work on it until you feel confident in the answer. Don't settle immediately on the first answer you find: explore a little. 

The only requirement is that you document your exploration. Create a folder that describes the current topic of exploration (e.g. /gambols/eigenvector-mutual-information-correlations). Within this folder, create scripts to probe the question. Generate figures, results, etc.

After you find something worthwhile, document the scripts by writing a README.md file within the folder that lists their purpose and describes the results.
