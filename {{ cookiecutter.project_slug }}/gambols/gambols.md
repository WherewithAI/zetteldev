# Gambols

In Gambols, you are encouraged to be maximally creative. The researcher will ask you a question: work on it until you feel confident in the answer. Don't settle immediately on the first answer you find: explore a little. 

The only requirement is that you document your exploration. Work in Jupyter notebooks whenever possible; these are cleaner than scripts.
